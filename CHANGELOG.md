### Changed

- Bump `@atproto/api` from 0.18.20 to 0.19.1
- Bump `@atproto/lex-cbor` from 0.0.11 to 0.0.14
- Bump `@atproto/syntax` from 0.4.3 to 0.5.0

## [1.7.0] - 2025-09-10

### Added

- Reply operation: media and website card support (commit 99e230e)
  - Attach images (up to 4) or a single video to replies; prevents mixing images and video in one reply

### Changed

- Refactored media handling for posts and replies
  - Centralized helpers to process media items and website cards, clearer validation and errors
  - More robust binary checks and Buffer validation before uploads
  - Cleaner embed assembly for images and video

### Developer Experience

- Adopted @n8n/node-cli for local dev, lint, build, and release workflows (scripts added)
- Fixed editor menu export: `index.js` now exports class constructors from `dist` so n8n can read node/credentials descriptions
- Prevent node auto-discovery duplicates: keep only the wrapper node under `nodes/Bluesky/Bluesky.node.ts`; move V1/V2 classes to `src/`

## [1.6.0] - 2025-09-10

### Fixed

- Binary Media Upload Fix: ensure images are correctly included in posts
  - Enhanced binary data validation and buffer handling

  - Updated `binaryUploadHelper.ts` to return optional `{ width, height }` aspectRatio per image with graceful fallback
  - Updated `postOperations.ts` to include aspectRatio in `app.bsky.embed.images` when available
